            <p>I made a Chrome plugin called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pivotal-tweaker/aodalckpkgijlndlnlhblojedfboaglg">Pivotal Tweaker</a>, it makes your Pivotal Tracker better. You can download the plugin by clicking on this huge button:</p>

<hr />

<p>Couple months ago I started working in <a href="http://copyin.com">Copyin</a>, where I first started using <a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com">Pivotal Tracker</a>. <br/>
I still remember the first day, while trying out the product, there came a bug(duh). As an exercise, I was asked to put in a story in Pivotal right away. At this point I know nothing about Pivotal.</p>

<p>I dived right in. &ldquo;Click on the big blue button,&rdquo; &ldquo;change it from feature to a bug,&rdquo; &ldquo;now assign it to Rob,&rdquo; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s icebox, backlog and current,&rdquo; &ldquo;you can estimate work time, mark stories from start to finish to delivered, and someone can come in to accept it&rdquo;&hellip; I had close to zero idea as how this thing works, there seems to be a million stories all in different colours, where is the story I just added in? Where does it say it was assigned to Rob? What do those columns mean?</p>

<p>All in all the experience was pretty disorientated, my first impression on Pivotal Tracker was bad.</p>

<p>After a few weeks in, Pivotal started to grow on me, it started to make sense, the colours were still confusing, but the rest of the features make sense. <br>
<strong>And how wonderful is it to be able to <a href="http://pivotallabs.com/github-service-hook-for-pivotal-tracker/">close a pivotal story using a git commit message</a>?</strong></p>

<hr />

<p>However, there&rsquo;s still a lot of noise, there are little things that annoys me daily in Pivotal Tracker. What frustrated me the most was: I cannot filter my story down within columns. <br />
It is very clever of Pivotal to let you hide columns, allowing you focus on the current stories, but it&rsquo;s like a feature half done. I care about <strong><span class="colour-1">my</span> <span class="colour-2">current</span></strong> stories, not everyone else&rsquo;s, nor the ones sitting in Icebox. And initials in plain text brakets are not clear enough, there&rsquo;s not much to add, they&rsquo;re just texts like everything around it, except that I care about them more.</p>

<p>Since I still need to use Pivotal Tracker, I started trying to hack the features I wanted.
One day <a href="http://www.peternixey.com">Peter</a> and I was having a meeting, we put up a Pivotal screen and tried to discuss my current focus, he said:</p>

<blockquote><p>Oh I wish there&rsquo;s some way I could filter them down to your stories..</p></blockquote>

<p>&lt;( ‵▽′)-σ  <br />
I took my laptop and show him my Pivotal Tracker, and the immediate response was:</p>

<blockquote><p>Oh please can I have that as well? PLEASE!</p></blockquote>

<p>So I wrote <a href="/2012/11/27/pivotal-stories/">this post</a>, where I shared how you easily toggle your stories with merely a bookmark, and how I re-styled parts of Pivotal so the information I care about jumps out.</p>

<p>Then our whole team found out, and they all want it! So I made it into a Chrome extension.</p>

<p>After you tried it, it&rsquo;d be super nice if you could give me a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pivotal-tweaker/aodalckpkgijlndlnlhblojedfboaglg/reviews">review</a> on Chrome Store, or better yet, share it or <a href="http://twitter.com/muanchiou">tweet to me</a> :)</p>
