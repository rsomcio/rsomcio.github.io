            <p>The other day, after reading <a href="/2013/02/07/phase/">Phases</a>, <a href="http://robertheaton.com/">Rob</a> said to me:</p>

<blockquote><p>You need to stop optimising for less minus points.</p></blockquote>

<p>He meant, I do this - I want more of &ldquo;less bad things happening&rdquo; than &ldquo;more good things happening.&rdquo; Since I never looked at things this way, it took me a while to get my head around what he was implying. And as it turns out, he was right. On that, I do.</p>

<p>I know I would now sound like a sad little girl who got dumped and couldn&rsquo;t get over it, well, go ahead and think that. Even when after I became aware of the fact that I&rsquo;m optimising for less minus point, I don&rsquo;t think it makes sense for me to do things the other way, which is aiming for the plus points.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say we are talking about achieving the same goal - <strong>Happiness</strong>. Who can deny that we all want happiness?<br />
However, what counts as happiness and how we achieve that would vary.</p>

<p>There had been good times, of course, good things happening, things that brought infinite joy to me at the time. But I&rsquo;ve gradually come to realise that, if when things come to an end, there would be devastation awaits, then it&rsquo;s not worth it; if when you take risks in the hope of getting happiness in return, you failed and instead gained sadness and frustration, it&rsquo;s not worth it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve recently had this discussion with someone, and the only conclusion we came to was, what&rsquo;s worthwhile or not is purely base on the individual. But then again, as Rob insists, some things are just not relative.</p>

<p>I find it even harder to wrap my head around the idea of there is this goal that we the people in the right mind must work towards. Can I not just prefer less sadness over risking for more happiness? Can I not just prefer to have an adequate amount of money rather than trying to filthily rich? Does thinking this way means I am wrong?</p>

<p>Being not sad or frustrated is enough for me. Yes I do want all the fun in the world you&rsquo;re having, but looking at the risks, I don&rsquo;t think they are worth it.</p>

<p>Perhaps it all boils down to how much I hate being sad or frustrated, perhaps I treat the down hills too heavily, perhaps I care about losing too much. But I can not yet see a world where those are not the case.</p>

<hr />

<p>So we all optimise for different things.</p>

<p>When the goal is having the most fun, it makes sense to jump through the hoops. So you see, that&rsquo;s your goal. Not mine. So here I&rsquo;m not going to jump through the hoops. I would love to have the fun, yes, if someone would just hand it over to me, who wouldn&rsquo;t? But I don&rsquo;t want to jump through the hoops, so I&rsquo;d rather not have them.</p>

<p>For now I&rsquo;m going back home, jump the hoops all you want, enjoy it, just don&rsquo;t count me in.</p>
