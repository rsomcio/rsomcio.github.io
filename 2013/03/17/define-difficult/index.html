            <p>Last time I went back home, my dad asked me all sorts of questions, trying to get a handle on my life.</p>

<p>I tried, but there are too many years left blank in their mind I think it began to be difficult to put the pieces together in a way that they make sense. This is the same for me when I look at their lives, or anyone in my family, and now even most of my close friends back there.</p>

<p>As I was talking to him, I looked back to the first 3 years I spent in the UK, and realised it is really hard to imagine what happened then, even for myself. How was I able to live that life and somewhat seemed to pull through?</p>

<p>Wait, no. It was not difficult. Not even close.</p>

<p>I guess by difficult we are talking about the &ldquo;real difficulties&rdquo;, right? The ones that leave people homeless, depressed, helpless and have actual significant impact on life? I know the sorts of things, and they happened to people, people who are not me. You? perhaps.</p>

<p>So what happened was not even close to those, they were not difficult, not comparing to the real difficulties. They were things I have been through, and nothing more, nothing worth dwelling on, nothing worth mentioning, as they were not difficult.</p>

<p>Now, since they were not difficult, what were they? mildly unpleasant? slightly unideal? bumps in the road? I know for sure I would rather not do it again, but I guess since they were not difficult, it is impossible for me to be more broken than anyone, right? But don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I know this is not a competition.</p>

<p>Except, everyone is comparing.</p>

<p>When something happens, it is so common for people to compare, because it is a way to relate, a way to understand and put one self in the same spot. We compare the situations to get a grasp of how to properly deal with certain things, compare by looking at how had people dealt with it in the past. So something far more difficult happened to someone, and that someone pull through, I guess then since my problem is way less significant, I should pull through too without a wink.</p>

<hr />

<p>To solve a problem, first you have to recognize there is a problem, isn&rsquo;t that true? But I think it is getting harder and harder to recognise problems.</p>

<p>Looks like what we have here is not difficult enough to be a problem. So, just pull through. You will be fine.</p>
