            <p>I had a great day, and here’s the journey:</p>

<p>Started by wandering on Twitter trying to catch the end of the endless twitter feed, I saw someone&rsquo;s conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/victorlin">@victorlin</a>(founder of Now.in - online broadcasting site). I followed Victor, and he followed me back shortly. Emm, then I decided to read through his previous tweets, and found <a href="https://vimeo.com/36579366">Inventing on Principle</a> by Bret Victor <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/worrydream">@worrydream</a>. And then I went on reading through Bret’s tweets.. Amazing how internet works, isn’t it? (Or amazing how time just vanishes..)</p>

<hr />

<p>Then at <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/worrydream">@worrydream</a> I found Jon Blow and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIfZAab4Oh0">Braid</a> through <a href="https://twitter.com/worrydream/status/190498158873288704">this tweet</a> <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/the-most-dangerous-gamer/8928/3/?single_page=true">this article</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>He has famously branded so-called social games like FarmVille “evil” because their whole raison d’être is to maximize corporate profits by getting players to check in obsessively and buy useless in-game items. (In one talk, Blow managed to compare FarmVille’s developers to muggers, alcoholic-enablers, Bernie Madoff, and brain-colonizing ant parasites.) Once, during an online discussion about the virtues of short game-playing experiences, Blow wrote, “Gamers seem to praise games for being addicting, but doesn’t that feel a bit like Stockholm syndrome?”</p>

<p><small>Taylor Clark on Jon Blow</small></p></blockquote>

<p>In the article, I found this paragraph most interesting for it reminds me of the talk from <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/nireyal">@nireyal</a> on <a href="http://goo.gl/qU9tp">Behavior by Design</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/500Startups">500</a>, he mentioned how FarmVille works in terms of getting people obsessive through habit (#part2 12m30s). At the time I thought of the desire engine as purely a tactic, and didn’t actually give any thoughts on the morality behind it.</p>

<blockquote><p>I am here to inspire people to use habit design and behavior design to do good.</p>

<p><small>Nir Eyal</small></p></blockquote>

<p>So I mentioned this to my colleague Robert who loves Nir very very much. Turns out careless me didn’t notice, but Nir did emphasized on wanting people to do good with the desire engine. He began the talk introducing the “vitamins and painkiller” concept, pointing out that there is a considerate amount of people creating the pain and selling you the painkiller, which in any way cannot be a good thing in my opinion.</p>

<p>As Jon Blow said, isn’t it just like Stockholm Syndrome for us to praise the businessmen for selling the painkiller? It should be a crime, seriously.</p>

<hr />

<blockquote><p>If you don’t want something to exist, don’t participate in it.</p>

<p><small>Mike Monterio</small></p></blockquote>

<p>If we understand how the desire engine works, are we sure we are using it for doing good? Did we all give serious thoughts into things we participate?</p>

<p>As an outsider suddenly stepped into the big wild world of start-ups, I couldn’t help but wonder, do all these entrepreneurs believe what they do is good? Or do they even care about doing good?</p>

<p>The reason why I have doubts on such subject is because I feel in Silicon Valley, during however short time I experienced, there is a huge pile of over flood money talk. People pitch things based on money, people talk about monetization, people ask for revenue, all the time. Non-stop.</p>

<p>Not saying it is wrong, it is probably the way things work around here. (Then this probably just answered my questions.) I just don’t like the constant money talk.</p>

<p>I don’t care who raise how much. The figures after the dollar sign means nothing to me. Not saying I don’t like money, but I think money should not be the motivation. If money is the motivation, doctors probably won’t mind stabbing you and then charge for bandaging you up.</p>

<p>The whole thing makes me feel like this is probably not the place to talk about doing good, but shouldn’t it be? cause this is the place with the talented!</p>

<hr />

<p>In the end of Bret Victor’s talk, he tried to elaborate why he believes in what he believes.</p>

<blockquote><p>When I see s violation of this principle, I don’t think of that as an opportunity. When I see creators constrained by their tools, and ideas compromised, I don’t say “oh good, an opportunity to make a product, opportunity to start a business.”</p>

<p><small>Bret Victor @CUSEC</small></p></blockquote>

<p>He compared inventing on principle with working on social causes. People don’t see a wrong in public wellness as an “opportunity,” an activist would feel it’s his responsibility to change the fact. An activist life-style can apply to people in the tech world as well. In his case, seeing ideas compromised by insufficient tools is an injustice that needs to be set straight.</p>

<p>“Do you believe him?” my colleague asked me, and somehow I was expecting this question. I said I believe this in the same way I believe Google does no harm.</p>

<p>Obviously I don’t and I won’t ever know if he actually follows his principles as an activist, but I’d very much like to believe he does. Not blindly believing for he’s done some awesome things, but knowing this is the path to take.</p>

<p>On another note, I always think it is just so easy for people like Bret Victor or Gary Vaynerchuk or Steve Jobs to say things like “Do what you love” or “Do what you believe in.” Because the most difficult part is knowing what that is, and have the skills to actually do something around it.</p>

<p>Oh well.</p>

<blockquote><p>There are many ways to live your life. That’s maybe the most important thing to realize in your life, that every aspect of your life is a choice. There are default choices. You can choose to sleepwalk through your life, and accept the path that is laid out for you. You can choose to accept the world as it is. But you don’t have to.</p>

<p>If there’s something in the world that you feel is a wrong, and you have a vision for what a better world could be, you can find your guiding principle, and you can fight for a cause.</p>
